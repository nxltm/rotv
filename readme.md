Corbin befriends four strong and powerful heroes scattered across space and time, from a young damsel of light to an ancient star dragon, They set out on grand adventures across dozens of strange new worlds, finding the source of the mysterious power that plagued the universe for eons, with the universe and its fate solely on their hands.

## Heroes

### Corbin Knox

> I have someone to love. Someone to protect. Someone to save.

Corbin, the fearful but selfless hero, and spiritual leader of the group. Once a dashing recruit with an insatiable hunger for adventure and space battles.

After failing to save his parents and abandoned on death's door, he encounters an ancient gem that not only heals him, but grants him reality-altering abilities.

With this newfound determination and power, he sets out to bring justice to those who wronged him.

His mother gave him a companion robot, PAC-1 (Personal Assistive Combatant) which she had designed and built herself for years to aid him in his travels.

### Diana Alza

> They consumed and destroyed me. Now, I am reborn and free.

Diana, the innocent and naÃ¯ve childhood friend of Corbin, parting ways on a voyage to a different sector of the galaxy.

She was revived by the spirit of a neutron star when the galaxy's wars began, but immediately fell to the Void. For almost a century she was rendered both a slave and a weapon, destroying all who would try to suppress her.

After being rescued by Corbin, a weakened Diana struggles to gain back her powers, while trying to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster.

She remains in a state of limbo from her corruption, but she swears on her last life to never be controlled ever again.

### Zaia Korsua

> - Guess someone's out here better than me.
> - Leave nothing alive.
> - Killed it. As always.
> - You can't stop what's coming.
> - Only time will tell.
> - Infinite lives, infinite chances.

Zaia, a "teenage" neon rogue with a complex persona: rebellious, adventurous, sociable and competitive on the outside, but deep down, she remains a loving and loyal friend.

Born into a royal family, Zaia was raised early on to be a warrior, training night and day with her parents and soaking up new parkour and combat knowledge like a sponge.

After barely surviving a war waged by a great empire, she was forced to store herself in a hybrid, biomechanical humanoid vessel. With this new body, she could adapt to any environment, reach breakneck speeds, and can face entire swathes of enemies with ease.

She longed for things to be how they were before the war, but she had no other choice but to abandon her royal title for her family's sake, even if it would risk dying again.

### Elios sar-Anirak

> Come with me and you will live.

Elios, the stoic mediator of the team. Speaks through visions, plans their next move and all the odds that could befall them. Taps into the minds and consciousness of his foes, enthralling them to his will.

He reveals that he was the last member of an ancient cosmic peacekeeping order dubbed the Conclave, tasked upon themselves to purge any Void evil before it overtakes anyone.

Now far away from Primordial status and clad in a rare metal armor, he befriended Drax. Together they travel the universe, hunting down those who would bring the universe to ruin.

### Drax Mathron

> Drax shall protect you, with his life!

Drax, an infernal dragon born from a core of a dying star, graces the vast emptiness of the cosmos, all to protect his own kind from the Void.

Having been saved by Elios himself after being subjugated by the Void in his previous life, Drax, now scarred and diminished into his lowest form, befriends him and soon joins Corbin on his quest.

His true form may be revealed only when necessary to become larger than a star, overwhelming his foes with pure strength and blazing fire.

### Talia Liro

Talia, a nomad born into her tribe of Liro, was torn after missing her rite of passage.

Guided by an amulet bestowed to her by her parents, she took on a journey to learn her true nature of her growing powers, leading her into a cave where an ancient stone once laid for eons.

She was wrapped inside a cocoon, transforming her into a new, even more powerful creature when the Void came to raid her domain too.

With bright-shining crystals adorning her, she could both move continents and rip apart planets, driven by the sheer will and spirit of the Geo-Helion.

# Why This Story

Helion is a story aimed for teens and young adults about finding a place in the universe amidst a world full of chaos and corruption. Taking place in the far future, Corbin's story will take you through an immersive journey of discovery and exploration, with a dynamic cast of companions, travelers and enemies.

This story explores all my childhood influences and inspirations and I want to inject every bit of life from the grand adventures I experienced as a kid into this world.

# Origins

The original idea for this universe sparked about five years ago when I was still a college freshman, around the same time. As I was going through a major period of anxiety during and after COVID-19, especially in the form of night terrors and horrors, I created Corbin Knox, my self insert, as a personal hero: I gave him the power to control his dreams and manifest them into reality.

I then discussed the story with Dad, and since we had a mutual love for space and sci-fi and we both liked Star Wars and StarCraft, we settled on a sci-fi universe... I was binge-watching a lot of space documentaries and watching countless short films on YouTube to find inspiration for future characters and stories, and that I did during my remaining time at college.

As the months grew into years we continually pitched ideas for our story. Dad wrote the key points while I imagined the characters and the plot in my head, and then even drawing them on paper with his supervision. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, drafting a plot for good measure, but even though the story was left incomplete, it would only forever remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

My personal universe, Helion, as it was called, was one of the few things that allowed me to both escape from my problems and get out of my comfort zone. I'm still fighting through my innermost conflicts and fears as I try to find a place of peace and belonging in a world of chaos and uncertainty; in perhaps one of the most dreaded and unforeseen phases of my personal life.

## Goals

The first goal is to make an artbook entirely dedicated to the characters, races and regions that would make up the story. The universe is vast, and the artbook is estimated to have a total of 100 pages or more. The deadline for this is October 2024.

If we could get to our stretch goal of \$10,000 I can complete the entire artbook myself, with help from a few friends. I'm currently serving national service while working on the plot, and raising funds to get an iPad Pro through doodle commissions, so I could immediately begin work on the artbook.

Our ultimate goal is to get the first issue out, and build a community so I could make more. I have 30+ characters mapped out with outlines for each of the regions. I also hope to make some merch such as T-shirts, posters and more!

## Characters

### Corbin

- Name: Corbin Knox
- Title: the Dark Star
- Age: 19
- Height: 178 cm
- Role: Protagonist
- Class: Fighter
- Race: Human
- Type: Cosmic/Dark
- Signature Move: Final Requiem

With a family lost and home destroyed, what was once a young ensign Corbin Knox witnessed what was the last few minutes of his life. But in a sliver of hope, an ancient, sentient gem finds him, reviving him and giving him a new purpose. His past has been preserved, but his future still remains uncertain.

Now with the ability to cross portals and alter the fabric of space-time itself, he must embark on a journey to new worlds (albeit with a few friends), all to save them from and root out the omniscient force that once consumed the world that left him behind. However, that would come at a price.

---

I created Corbin at a time in my life when I was really anxious, having night terrors every other night and somehow in one way or another it would always result in me dying in the end. I made Corbin the opposite: that early on in the story he would be minutes away from dying, then be resurrected and be granted a power which could allow him to alter reality with his mind.

I had to nerf him to the abyss in order to be more feasible for our story, as I simply could not let our hero go, win the fight and save the day. So instead of that we gave him a stone (or really, four) that could enable him to do so: we gave him the name _Uncreator_ but that changed into _the Dark Star_ instead to signify that he could manipulate the space-time continuum with only his mind.

From the beginning I knew that he was going to be a reality-altering hero, yet he still does not yet fully understand the scope of his powers. I gave him a typical backstory of a teenage soldier drafted into war (since I was going into my military phase) and based it around the story of an attack on his own sector by a Void raid, like the first episode of _Gargantia_ or _Evangelion_. His surname, Nox, was also changed to Knox to signify his human origins. In addition, I also created him a family, and a companion robot, PAC-1, to guide him on his journey throughout the entire saga, built by his mother, Evelynn.

I dabbled quite a bit on his color palette and thought of giving him a blue, red or purple main color, and some tones of black, white and grey, before settling on red, since red is the best color for an anime protagonist like him. He was both the easiest and hardest character to design because I knew he was going to be a human, and even retained his former human body and handsome anime looks, but coming up with his abilities and higher forms was a pain.

### Izona

- Name: Izona Hoshino
- Title: the White Star
- Age: 18
- Height: 173 cm
- Role: Deuteragonist
- Race: Human/Luminary
- Type: Light/Void
- Signature Move: Final Spark

Izona Hoshino parted ways with Corbin on a voyage to a different part of the galaxy, before being revived by the spirit of a neutron star during a war with the Void. However, not before long, she was also captured, becoming its slave and weapon. For almost a century, she fought constantly not to be controlled, but she failed, destroying all that would come her way.

When she was saved by Corbin, she had only grew stronger, a goddess turned deadly huntress, yet a small vestige of her Void self remained. She tries to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster, and relinquishes her past not remembering how she once failed, not wanting again to be submitted to the Void once more.

---

Izona started out as a counterpart to Corbin and was initially going to be his chief antagonist who would somehow try to defeat him, but that would not be enough. At first, Izona was going to be an evil egomaniac with the power to counter Corbin, but as a being of light and Corbin being a being of dark, she had to undergo a change. And since Corbin's powers were based around black holes, Izona's was based on neutron stars.

I based her new design around three from League of Legends, Lux, Syndra and Kai'Sa, and similar to Corbin, give her a human origin. The entire Void idea came from Kai'Sa, and her story went something like this: Izona was once a damsel of light, as innocent as Lux would, then a egotistical, narcissistic figure like Syndra that is Ira, then emerged as a strong resolute fighter like Kai'Sa when she was rescued and purified.

In designing her, I combined elements of the three characters and blending it with my own take. I gave

Her initial name was not Izona, but named after my friend Astrid whom I met in polytechnic first year. That got changed into Sabrina, Liana, Diana, and finally into Izona as Diana was going to be used in a later story. She was later given the surname Hoshino out of good measure.

### Zaia

- Name: Zaianira Korsua
- Title: the Neon Rogue
- Age: 20 (human), 14,111 (Itira)
- Height: 168 cm
- Role: Tritagonist
- Race: Itira/Human
- Type: Electric/Fighting
- Signature Move: Final Requiem
- Forms: Normal, Attack, Defense, Speed, Instinct, Balance, Rampage, Ultimate

Once a curious young princess destined to succeed her kingdom, Zaia's own life was left hanging by a thread as a result of the Old War. Her body was replaced by a human's, a lot different from her previous, yet she still kept her former power.

In desperation, she casts aside her title of queen-in-waiting, and though she held onto all she had learnt from her parents and from the challenges she faced, she vowed to protect her family and kind from any force of evil, no matter if it risked her life again. She may strike her enemies down at any moment, but one thing is certain: she will never remain silent... until her calling is fulfilled.

---

From the beginning I imagined Zaia as an inquisitive, intelligent hacker, using nanotech to breach defenses while focusing mainly on stealth, prodigious combat and ludicrous speed. She also came from my love of Gundam, Ninja Warrior and video game speedruns, ever since I was a child.

When I was browsing through League, around the time True Damage came about, I instantly fell in love with the champion Akali and her True Damage skin, including her persona and hairstyle, and I longed to add someone like her in my story. But rather than just another techwear parkour human ninja, I decided to pull a 180 on her and create something entirely different: subsuming a robot, alien and human into the same character.

It took me a while to find something that could be of inspiration but eventually I found the game Warframe, and chose skins that more or less resembled exo-suits: Zephyr Harrier, Nova Atomica and Mag Orbit, as well as additional influence from the Metroid protagonist Samus Aran.

But the real inspiration for her came from video game logic and their applications in the real, physical universe. I was always amazed at characters doing impossible things, such as passing and clipping and parkour-ing through objects with no collision, running, jumping and falling at warp speeds, and razing enemies and bosses to the ground with overpowered weapons.

That lead me to the idea and through frequent discussions with Dad that she would be an energy-based character, and that she would be able to use her energy to do more than just lag, glitch and zip at light speeds, something I used to joke about with my little brother a lot. XD

I chose cyan, orange and space gray as her primary colors, a combination I deemed best suited for her personality and cyberpunk aesthetic, and then gave her the name _Neon Rogue_ rather than _Glitch Rogue_.
