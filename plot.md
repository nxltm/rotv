# Prologue

Before the dawn of time, the One created the Cosmos, seeding domains from the Rift formed out of the Void. Domains with millions of galaxies and quadrillions of stars, birthed with uniquely sentient life in vast numbers, growing into thriving civilizations throughout the eons.

Hidden in the cores of massive celestial bodies and primordials, the protectors of these domains, the relics of creation, the Helion, could bind to living hosts to tap into the power and mind of the cosmos and its inner workings, allowing to manipulate space and time to their will.

Existing between the domains was the Sanctuary, an alternate plane where the Watchers dwelled. They, countless in number, were ancient beings begat from the Helion themselves, destined to guide civilizations old and new to their intended purpose, while forging trust and peace between the empires.

However, sin soon captured the hearts of some of the Watchers. Omegron, a Celestial Watcher, uncovered this secret of the Helion. He wanted them all for himself, having realized the immense power they had at his possession. This knowledge was soon passed on to the many empires who too realized their power.

The empires turned cruel and bitter in hatred, tussling among themselves to gain access to the crystals and their power. Open warfare raged across the universe, riving even the empires which remained silent and peaceful.

With the use of the Helion, the other Celestials, including Altara, Trisa, Seirio and Kynos, managed to quell the war, but it had been significant enough that even the most intelligent and developed empires now struggled to survive.

For his betrayal the Celestials cast Omegron back into the Void abyss after the Old War. As he knew he was too weak to wage another war against them, he shaped his own empire from the crude matter of the Universe. Populating the Void by synthesizing his own beings, they were programmed with an extreme degree of adaptability, procreation and resilience, bordering on true self-replication.

Coupled with their countless innate abilities, they proved to be a formidable threat for the Universe. Time and time again, these erratic, sentient beings travel, observe, listen and learn to the secrets of the Universe at the bidding of their master in the Dark Void, only waiting for the day he would be set free.

As he slowly grew vengeful as a result of his loss, he sent his son Mavron, the Revenant, whom he created himself, under a humanoid appearance to serve as a parasite from within. He had a single purpose---to destroy the Universe from within and annihilate all the Helion crystals for his father-figure and creator.

Mavron was created just like the rest of the Void-born, and had lived the same life, but furious against the atrocities of his father, reprogrammed himself by subsuming a crystal in hopes to save himself. Having barely sealed the Void Gates, he kept the Universe safe from its retaliation.

# Book 1 | Rise of the Void

Enemies from an unknown domain raided dozens of colonies throughout the galaxy; death following in its wake. And in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin barely survived. In a sliver of hope, an ancient gem seeks and heals him. Left with no choice, our hero sets out on a dangerous quest across the universe, to crush the very evil that stole them away.

## Prologue to Humanity

Sol grew into a red giant, forcing humanity out of the Origin System and into the Milky Way galaxy. They explored and settled in hundreds of new moons and planets, and in centuries, these colonies grew and prospered, into metropolises swarmed with a mixture of humans and their robot companions living in harmony.

Genetic engineering and biomechanical augmentations kept their frail bodies alive, resulting in the average human lifespan increasing to 2000 Earth years, enough for them to survive the stretched out timelines of other planets and outer space.

## An Unknown Enemy

For many centuries humanity had yet to face its greatest crisis yet, what had been thought as their greatest achievement---alien contact. But enemies from an unknown domain were heading their direction. Some fled to other galaxies, but most were left in ruin.

## Prepare for War

Garrett Knox, former commander of the main fleet, was specially called to handle the case, and upon close examination he noticed something amiss, realizing only too soon the signals were approaching in their direction.

He mobilized an impressive fleet of drones, missiles, star ships and battle suits in his base and on the surrounding planets and asteroids, and ordered the evacuation of all citizens on board the _Maelstrom_, the main ship, leaving only the military to defend the base.

## Our Last Day

Corbin, junior ensign gets summoned, initiated and deployed into battle. He, accompanied by his robot, PAC-1 which his mother gave to him, was operating a biomechanical space suit alone, synced to his brain through a means known as _transference_. Several of their weapons proven ineffective,

The battle was gruesome, and Corbin's side suffered heavy losses. In a desperate attempt to save his parents, Corbin was severely injured and on the verge of dying, after succumbing to a devastating blast to his ship.

## Reawakening

Parsecs away, Corbin spotted a rare cosmic anomaly in the distance---the merger of four galaxies, forming and compounding itself into a hybrid sentient gem, approaching his direction. Corbin, now on the verge of dying, grabs the mysterious gem that was laying down on his side, thinking to himself that the gem "chose" him.

## The Dark Star

A miasma quickly envelops him, encrusting itself into his chest, as he ascends into space, and in a fit of rage, extends out his right arm, releasing black holes to slowly consume them into nothingness, just as the rest of the fleet retreated back into the Void. Corbin, exhausted and unconscious, falls back down into the ground where he came from.

## New Company

Parsecs from where the battle took place, a mysterious figure witnessed how Corbin had fought off the Void as he later revealed to him. He travels to his rescue, discovering Corbin's partially dead body unconscious, and his companion floating above attempting to revive him, and flew him on a journey out of the galaxy.

## Lost in Translation

As Corbin wakes up while partially recovering, he spots the mysterious figure, who, as it turned out, was none other than Elros, accompanied by his "sworn brother" Drax, in his diminished form. Giving Corbin a translation device, Elros reveals to him that this "unknown enemy" that raided his galaxy was none other than the Void.

## Outbound

Arriving on another planet, Corbin and Elros were greeted by Talia, a young exiled stone-weaver who wandered off from her homeland in search of the survivor. Talia clothed both of them, as the group wandered desert after desert, searching for a place where they could rest. They eventually spotted a nearby village just across the shifting dunes in a nearby outpost.
