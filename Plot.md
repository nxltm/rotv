# Prologue

Before the dawn of time, the One created the Cosmos, seeding many domains from the Rift formed out of the Void. Domains with a multitude of galaxies with vast numbers of stars, were birthed with uniquely sentient life in vast numbers, growing into thriving civilizations throughout the eons.

Hidden in the cores of many celestial bodies lie the relics of all creation, the Helion, which could bind to living hosts to tap into the mind and power of the cosmos and its inner workings, allowing to control and manipulate space and time itself.

Between the domains was the Sanctuary, an alternate plane where the Watchers dwelled. They, countless in number, were ancient beings begat from the Helion themselves, destined to guide civilizations old and new to their intended purpose, while forging trust and peace between the empires.

However, sin soon captured the hearts of sr ome of the Watchers. Omegron, a Celestial Watcher, uncovered this secret of the Helion. He wanted them all for himself, having realized the immense power they had at his possession. This knowledge was soon passed on to the many empires who too realized their power.

The empires turned cruel and bitter in hatred, tussling among themselves to gain access to the crystals and their power. Open warfare raged across the universe, riving even the empires which remained peaceful and silent.

With the use of the Helion, the other Celestials, including Altara, Trisa, Seirio and Kynos, managed to quell the war, but it had been significant enough that even the most intelligent and developed empires now struggled to survive.

For his betrayal the Celestials cast Omegron back into the Void abyss after the Old War. As he knew he was too weak to wage another war against them, he shaped his own empire from the crude matter of the Universe. Populating the Void by synthesizing his own beings, they were programmed with an extreme degree of adaptability, procreation and resilience, bordering on true self-replication.

Coupled with their countless innate abilities, they proved to be a formidable threat for the Universe. Time and time again, these erratic, sentient beings travel, observe, listen and learn to the secrets of the Universe at the bidding of their master in the Dark Void, only waiting for the day he would be set free.

As he slowly grew vengeful as a result of his loss, he sent his son Mavron, the Revenant, whom he created himself, under a humanoid appearance to serve as a parasite from within. He had a single purpose---to destroy the Universe from within and annihilate all the Helion crystals for his father-figure and creator.

Mavron was created just like the rest of the Void-born, and had lived the same life, but furious against the atrocities of his father, reprogrammed himself by subsuming a crystal in hopes to save himself. Having barely sealed the Void Gates, he kept the Universe safe from its retaliation.

# Book 1 | Rise of the Void

Enemies from an unknown domain raided dozens of colonies throughout the galaxy; death following in its wake. And in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin barely survived. In a sliver of hope, an ancient gem seeks and heals him.

Left with no choice, our hero sets out on a dangerous quest across the universe, to crush the very evil that stole them away...but first, he has to find some friends to help him first.

## Prologue to Humanity

As Sol _(the Sun)_ grew into a red giant, it forced humanity out of the Origin System _(the Solar System)_ outward. They explored and settled in hundreds of new moons and planets, and in centuries, these colonies grew and prospered, into metropolises swarmed with a mixture of humans and their robot companions living in harmony.

Genetic engineering and biomechanical augmentations kept their frail bodies alive, resulting in the average human lifespan increasing to 2000 Earth years, enough for them to survive the stretched out timelines of other planets and outer space.

## Our Last Days

For many centuries humanity had yet to face its greatest crisis yet, what had been thought as their greatest achievement---alien contact. But enemies from an unknown domain were heading their direction. Some fled to other galaxies, but it was too late---as Garrett Knox already found out, most were already left in ruin.

## Prepare for War

Garrett, commander of the main fleet, examining closely the signals, and he noticed something amiss, realizing only too soon they were approaching in his base's direction.

Garrett mobilized an impressive fleet of drones, missiles, star ships and battle suits in his base and on the surrounding planets and asteroids, and ordered the evacuation of all citizens on board the _Maelstrom_, the main ship, leaving only the militia to protect the base.

## An Unknown Enemy

Corbin, junior ensign, gets summoned, initiated and deployed into battle. He, accompanied by his robot, PAC-1, gifted by his mother during his childhood, was operating a biomechanical space suit alone, synced to his brain through a means known as _transference_. Several of their weapons proven ineffective, resulting in Corbin's side suffering heavy losses.

In a desperate attempt to save his parents, Corbin was severely injured and on the verge of dying, after succumbing to a devastating blast to his suit.

## Reawakening

Parsecs away, Corbin spotted a rare cosmic anomaly in the distance---the merger of four galaxies, forming and compounding itself into a hybrid sentient gem, approaching his direction. Corbin, now on the verge of dying, grabs the mysterious gem that was laying on his side, with an afterthought that the gem "chose" him to grant him another chance of life again.

## The Dark Star

A miasma takes over him, encrusting itself into his chest, appearing to reanimate his mangled body. Ascending into space, a livid Corbin extends out his right arm releasing a dark beam that stretched across the skies...before the same miasma gem lulled him asleep and began healing him.

## New Company

His robot was the only thing left "alive", as it tries to broadcast emergency signals to alert anyone it could find. Parsecs away, a mysterious figure witnessed how Corbin vanquished _the Void_, and while unconscious, escorted him out of the galaxy.

## Lost in Translation

As Corbin wakes up, he was greeted by two new strangers: a wise ancient named Elros and his "sworn brother" Drax, in his diminished form. Giving Corbin a translation device, Elros reveals to him that this "unknown enemy" that raided his galaxy was none other than the Void.

## Outbound

The three arrive in a strange planet in the domain Elros calls Sefa, a strange and seemingly alien realm dotted with floating islands and an endless sky. A humanoid, appearing as a composite of rocks and crystals, comes to greet them.

## The Stone-Weaver

She, revealing her name as Talia, 

Arriving onto a terrestrial planet somewhere within the domain of Sefa, Corbin, Elros and Drax were greeted by a young stone-weaver named Talia, who also received word of Corbin, as the group wandered about searching for a particular place where they could rest. They eventually spotted a nearby village just across the shifting dunes in a nearby outpost.

Talia took the group into the city to rest. As they reached her house, she revealed to her about a prophecy, insisting on traveling with Corbin to his journey to save the hidden crystals. As

then got on a boat and rowed him towards the Grand City entrance, with his robot now disguised as a totem. Leaving the boat, they were caught by dark figures which surrounded Corbin, Talia, and the robot. Talia fights them off with her earth-weaving powers, while Corbin, still in his suit, levitates and spins the monsters around, contorting them from the inside. But as Corbin managed to defeat the monsters, Talia was left wounded with an accursed blade, falling deathly ill from the wound. She was nearly captured and sent into the Void, but Corbin ejected invisible black holes to scavenge the remains of the monsters while grasping her dearly with his arms.
