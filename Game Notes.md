# Game Notes

_Rise of the Void: the Game_ is a science fantasy-themed TPS (third-person shooter) action-adventure RPG (role-playing game) blending elements from games like Warframe, Final Fantasy, Destiny, Apex Legends, Titanfall and Doom: Eternal.

## Quests

Quests are a set of interlinked missions that provide lore for the game and also award or unlock specific heroes domains, weapons, or vehicles, as well as their relevant cosmetics on completion.

These are divided into two distinct groups: **Story** and **Side**. Only the tutorial quest, "Our Last Day", cannot be skipped. All quests, except those which temporarily disable access to missions or the Sanctuary (player menu), can be replayed.

A player can only take one quest at a time, but they could clear their active quest to focus on missions.

Side quests are optional.

## Missions

Missions are secondary to the game, unlike Warframe. Here, up to five players can participate in the same missions as a Team, and upon completing objectives, exit the mission. Most of these missions are primarily PvE.

Each mission has a specific pre-assigned objective, although secondary objectives or a change of objective may occur during the mission. A lot of these missions are based on Warframe, however with very notable differences, e.g. called differently.

### PVE

#### Standard

- **Bossfight**: Defeat a boss.
- **Exterminate**: Kill a predetermined number of enemies placed across the map.
- **Rescue**: Guide an ally to the exit, without triggering alarms or alerting enemies.
- **Sabotage**: Infiltrate the enemy base, and cripple their operation by striking at vulnerable points.
- **Abduct**: Capture and abduct targets who would try to escape.
- **Defend (Multiple)**: Defend targets across multiple locations, one at a time. The number of targets will vary.
- **Defend (Mobile)**: Defend and guide a moving target to the exit.
- **Eavesdrop**: Find intelligence inside enemy territory without being detected either by enemies or traps.

#### Endless

The longer the mission, the harder the enemies become.

- **Capture**: Capture a number of relay points while defending against an enemy. (De)buffs may be applied to either side.
- **Survive**: A timed mission. Collect orbs around the map or dropped by enemies to add seconds to the timer. Once time runs out, it's too late.
- **Defend (Stationary)** : Defend a stationary target; every 5 waves you can choose to finish the mission or continue fighting for a max of 30 waves.

#### Special

- **Bounty**: Fulfil a series of objectives strung together in a single mission while exploring a landscape, giving rewards upon success.
- **Quest**: Already covered above.
- **Free-Roam/Free-Flight**: Pose and take a shot.

### PVP

- **Gauntlets**: Parkour-race while facing against hordes of enemies. 1v7.
  - Unlocked upon completing _Zaia: Neon Rogue_ chapter and _Gauntlets of Itira_ side quest.
- **Squad Gauntlet**: Gauntlets. 5v5.
- **Duel**: Two champions battle against one another.
- **Royale**:

## Domains

Domains branch out from Terra's _Origin System_, into other domains called "Gates". Each domain or galaxy would have 20 _nodes_ which correspond to a notable place within the domain. Completing a mission for the first time marks the node complete as white, connected incomplete nodes as blue, and locked ones as red.

The story quests take place on any node within these domains.

Early game, these domains would be:

1. **Terra** → _Sefa_
2. **Sefa** → _Luenia_
3. **Luenia** → _Endora_
4. **Endora** → _Helgama_
5. **Endora** → _Itira_
6. **Itira** → _Void_

A domain could have multiple gates to or from itself. Itira/Nakta/Atala lead to each other and so do Luenia/Klypsa.

Several gates require quests to be completed in order for it to be unlocked. Additionally, a number of gates award quests on completion.

1. **Terra** → _Itira_
2. **Terra** → _Sefa_
3. **Itira** ↔ _Nakta_
4. **Itira** ↔ _Atala_
5. **Itira** → _Luenia_
6. **Itira** → _Endora_
7. **Nakta** ↔ _Atala_
8. **Atala** → _Sylva_
9. **Atala** → _Nyrphia_
10. **Atala** → _Zuroa_
11. **Luenia** → _Helgama_
12. **Luenia** ↔ _Klypsa_
13. **Klypsa** → _Nyrphia_
14. **Nyrphia** → _Corunda_
15. **Nyrphia** → _Void_
16. **Corunda** → _Atala_
17. **Corunda** → _Sylva_
18. **Klypsa** → _Void_
19. **Nyrphia** → _Zuroa_
20. **Zuroa** → _Endora_ \_

## XP and Ranks

Ranks are a method of tracking how much content a player has experienced with points earned by:

- completing quests and missions
- upgrading heroes, weapons, vehicles, companions
- unlocking domains
- fulfilling achievements
- participating in events and competitions
- performing actions such as trading
- playing with the **Helion GO!** app.

Above 30, every rank is marked as Luminary: LR: 3, up to level 50.

In order to be promoted to the next rank, a player must fulfil a **desired set of objectives** for each progressive rank they are trying to achieve, **not** a test, similar to Pokemon GO.
