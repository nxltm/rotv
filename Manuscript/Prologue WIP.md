# Chapter 0 | the Prequel


<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I dreamt</span> of happier times. I dreamt of the days when I was with Dad, as we watched the stars together and everything in the vast reaches of space fly away from the window. I remembered how I would press myself against the glass, desperately hoping to see something glide out into the open. I dreamt: would it be an adventure or perhaps even a grand odyssey, like the one Dad used to tell me when I couldn't sleep?

I dreamt of bittersweet days of when Mom raised me. I dreamt of how beautiful she was, how incredible her voice was, or how she guided me even when she was lightyears away in her job. I remembered how kind she was, whether it be towards myself or the people she meets that she calls "company." I remember the little gifts which she brought back after the many months I never saw her, _including_ the one which she spent many years creating especially for me. I dreamt of the next time I would meet her face-to-face and proudly call her Mom like I always would.

I dreamt of terrible times, of how lost I was when without my parents; no one was there to offer kind words of help or encouragement, of how to comfort and console ourselves when we have failed, or how frail we were without someone to guide us. I dreamt of how helpless we had been once, lost and confused, without someone to teach us what we could and couldn't do. I could not remember how we ended up here, and even now, we fail to realize that we are but children. I dreamt of the day I would see Mom and Dad again.

I remember every dream I must have had since the day I was born. I remember how awful, bittersweet, or joyful each of my dreams had been. But now, I'm stuck with myself and a bunch of crude people who have failed to recognize who this boy is.

There are days when I fail to recognize who I am, instead of thinking I am in a nightmare, desperately trying to wake up, expecting happier days ahead of me. But I know that I am not dreaming. I know this would have to end soon. I knew I had to stand up for myself, which would await me would be a trying time. Even so, I'll have to make the best of it.

And I believe that time has to be **now**.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eons ago,</span> the One created the Universe. Now the Universe was but void, only nothing but darkness. It was riven from deep within, birthing a cluster of galaxies, nebular and stellar systems. Each realm was connected to the Tree of Life, sowed and weaved by the One himself.

And in each realm was seeded a civilization, unique in sentience, evolution, forms, features, capabilities, lifespans, and life source, dictated by the environment they lived in.

He created an unborn and formless cosmic wisp, once drifting aimlessly across the universe, containing her within a chrysalis---a supermassive neutron star. He also made four Luminaries, each embodying the spirit of a great light: Kynos, Seirun, Danar, and Trisa.

These mighty beings did not possess material form ~~nor were they even aware of their sentience~~ and knew not who their creator was. They swore themselves to protect the Universe with their very lives, helping to bring peace and protection to these beings of all kinds, to help them prosper, grow, thrive, and evolve as they raced toward rapid expansion and progress in their civilization.

But there was a **second** force, screaming into existence with the birth of the Universe: **The Void**.

It was a vast canvas of nothingness, forever shrouded in mystery. Manifesting itself into a gargantuan force of beings with such insatiable hunger, they reigned over the Realms for eons, bringing division, terror, and demise on the Realms in what was the **Old War**. And soon enough, the neutron star that sealed the wisp had been seized by the Void. It was given a human form. She was proclaimed to all as Ira, its Daughter.

The Luminaries tried all their best to protect the realms from their evident destruction, leaving behind four pieces of a sacred Crystal. They hid them in four different corners of the Universe. Little was known about their sole purpose, and little would they know when or who will seize them again.

Many civilizations were left on the brink of extinction. The realms collided with one another, causing portals to appear in every domain, which pulled different species, flora or fauna, into another. The new beings evolved over millions of sidereal years, losing their former powers and taking on new forms. Some became beings of legend, myth, or folklore, others challenging our very own concept of existence and of life itself.

Good eve, everyone.

I'm happy to join you today. This century has been a big challenge for us. We were made to prepare for something which we and _all_ civilizations never knew about.

Over tens of thousands of years, our ancestors went from primitive mammals to an advanced civilization. They amassed together and grouped themselves according to the tongue. They built massive empires, societies, and economies, invented new things, and lived through many years of peace and freedom. But they have also fought many wars and endured many crises, famines, pestilence, and death alike, leaving thousands if not millions or even billions dead in its wake.

An entirely new age took off on the days we charted the stars. We discovered planets that lie behind our reach through telescopes and have landed two men on the Moon. Soon enough, over many decades, we built if not hundreds of spacecraft on the Moon and Mars and set up outposts on both, calling them our future homes. We had discovered new resources and materials that we could use and learned how to use them.

Through the many advancements in medical science and bioengineering, we have found a way to reverse and even cease the pains of age. We have used technologies to replace the memories and the family members we have lost by safely transferring their conscience to a new and fresh clone. We have found new ways to end global pestilence and pandemics in a single month, eradicating deadly pathogens and chemicals before they would eliminate ours. We used these resources gathered from the asteroids, comets, and moons in our solar system, and harnessed their chemical and physical properties to protect us from these harmful environments.

Over many decades we had built a giant space-ark, an entire fleet of them, greater than Noah's, to carry us, our resources and the very things we cherish, as well as our hopes and dreams, for a new, better humanity.

For many years we thought of finding new life, and hoping that our questions would never go answered.
