**17711 CE | BETA ORIONIS | ASTERRA**

<span class=smcp>An unknown</span> fleet triggered a wave of distress signals around the Milky Way. Thousands of colonies all around the galaxy had gone into a state of chaos. Fear had already crippled the hearts of every civilian. Blatant ignorance paralyzed them.

Humanity deemed themselves unfit for living in the Old World. Hundreds of asteroids and moons throughout the Origin System had been harvested for this feat, in a desperate attempt for them to find new homes. Now, thousands of cities and settlements sprang all around the galaxy, Asterra, a small mining facility roughly the size of Ceres, was just one of them. Nothing was unique about Asterra, despite it still being a tiny metropolis stacked with mega-structures and swarmed by robots. And by that point, when genetic engineering and biomechanical implants kept their frail bodies alive when their organs would usually fail, the average human lifespan was a staggering nine hundred Earth-years.

But now, in an era when society was still brainwashed for many centuries, humanity was about to witness its impending doom. For eons the very _concept_ of alien sentience was only dismissed as some sort of conspiracy or fiction. Now as outposts were emptied and carrier ships warped to a nearby galaxy, only the trained were left to defend and sacrifice themselves, and test their mettle against their unknown enemy. But for young cadets like Corbin, it was just another space battle that wound satisfy his insatiable hunger.

Garrett Knox, his father, the galaxy's most respected admiral, deployed countless unmanned drones and spacecraft on the surrounding asteroid belt to thin up enemy numbers. Within hours the fleet had been assembled. Corbin and the rest of the cadet corps were deployed to the battle suits. On a rare mission that seemed to be both intimate and personal, a young Corbin was unwillingly lead to his _last_ fight of his life.

// Corbin was directed into his suit

An automated voice began echoing inside his suit.

"Starting initiation sequence. This is Unit K-3121, pilot Ensign Corbin Knox. Measuring brainwaves. Normal. Adrenaline output. Normal. Blood pressure. Normal. Initiation complete. Ensign Knox, ready for battle."

"Huh!?" Corbin was confused. "Where's the enemy now?" A tooltip opened from the right side of his display.

"Corbin, you're okay. Ready for a tough battle up ahead?" "Yes, sir---uh---_dad_. Where's everyone? And where's Commander Eve?" "She's on board the _Maelstrom_, the command center. It's alright, son."

Garrett shifted his conversation to all the cadets in his squad.

"Attention, everyone. I've trusted that you have been initiated and ready to await further instructions."

"And?"

"In fifteen minutes, the entire fleet will be entering from behind planet Ryko through a Rift wormhole. We will approach in line of sight with the Void-Core, surrounded by a swarm of enemy ships. This is a surprise attack; using everything we have to throw at them. If we fail, consider our future lost. Over."

"Copy."

ON-1, Corbin's companion robot, took control of his mainframe. "Notice: As of now, your time in military service has exceeded 12 years. Knox, should you survive, your rank will be immediately upgraded to Junior Lieutenant."

"Really, mom?" Corbin doubted.

"Good job, and good luck."

Another tooltip opened on his screen. "This is Evelyn Knox, Senior Lieutenant Commander speaking. The enemy will be approaching at us any moment now."

"Copy that, mom."

Garrett began his first announcement through his mainframe. "All units, we will be approaching the Rift very soon. As soon as Transference is complete, we launch. Good luck, and good hunting. Over."

Evelyn entered a command on her system to open up the wormhole. "All ships, prepare for Transference."

An automated voice echoed through Corbin's seat: "Initiating in T-minus 30 seconds."

"Enter the Rift! Now!" Garrett commanded.

Evelyn, rummaging through her own display for a bit, brought up her readings.

"We confirm the enemy fleet has passed through the Rift. All Kaijus, proceed to the designated coordinates and begin launching your Warp Bombs."

"Upon sighting the Void-Core, all Kaijus and Cobras on the vanguard will begin a barrage of fire on it," Garrett commanded.

Evelyn opened up her console and began drafting the readings to the fleet. "Energy levels rising on the Core."

The fleet awaited fire at the enemy Void-Core.

"Prepare your onboard Tachyon Beams." The Kaijus charged their beams on the enemy, docking them from the back.

"FIRE!"

The beams from the Kaijus focused on the enemy core, lighting up in a symphony of chaos. As soon as all were exhausted, the Void-Core burst open like a blossoming flower, quickly wiping out drones with a single strike.

"The frontlines have been annihilated! Remaining ships have suffered massive damage!"

The Kaijus from the rear steered through enemy fire that pierced through the stars, so as not to avoid further damage.

"Fire from remaining rear Kaijus have struck! We've destroyed the Void-Core!"

Garrett affirmed them. "Good. Now, Couteau Squad, prepare the Delta-Bomb. We will use our new weapon, to quickly shed off the enemy Void-Core, and blow it to smithereens."

Evelyn took a peek at the enemy contraption from the console. "It appears that this core is like a 'brain' that controls the rest of the fleet. Recommended that we destroy it."

While the Kaijus quickly assembled into position, locking on and returning fire at the rest of the enemy Void-Core, Garrett escorted the Couteau Squad into the Void-Core to plant an antimatter nuke. "Kaijus. Fire!" Garrett exclaimed. "Focus on the enemy front!"

In an instant, the Void-Core released a swarm of fallen beings from its outer core.

"Multiple vehicles have been launched from the Void-Core! More inbound!" Evelyn passed on the numbers from her console to Garrett.

The Kaijus steered clear of every blast that emanated from the enemy ships. As the enemies tried to get on their tail, they locked on and returned fire, their turrets swiveling back and forth, showering their fire on each enemy ship.

While the _Trident_ was preparing to engage in departure, the rest of the fleet began reassembling themselves back into formation and gone back into formation as they pressured themselves into fighting the enemy.

The squad advanced, ready to plant the antimatter bomb on the fringe of the core. "Avanys Squad is closing in on the Void-Core. Two minutes until bomb is planted."

Corbin's Kaiju suit scrambled on a massive wreck, throwing his burst wide of his intended target. "The core is regenerating too quickly, Dad! What should we do!?"

"Is the Delta-Beam ready to fire again?" Evelyn asked. "It's still recharging! We won't be able to make it!"

It was at that very moment that Corbin knew that they _clearly_ were no match against them.

"Impossible! How can they still survive even with this many ships?" Garrett was furious.

The Void-Core fired once more, but this time, directly on the main fleet.

"Enemy Void-Core has fired on the main fleet! The formation has been destroyed!" Corbin checked the readings on his screen. He looked out of the viewport, but with most of the view taken up by drifting clumps of wreckage and clouds of frozen biofuel spewing from ruptured tanks.

"All ships, withdraw! Everybody, get off the Antimatter Nuke! We won't last much longer here!" Corbin, mustering enough courage, began issuing his orders.

Panic edged on Evelyn's mind. "Wait a minute, Corbin! Are we going to leave the bomb behind, including the energy core and everything?"

"No. Just leave. Let it do its thing."

The phasers started simultaneously bursting out enemies, one by one, as Corbin tussled head-on with the enemy, ripping them up with immense force. Corbin began firing whatever beams he could from his Kaiju suit's emitters and weapons, taking down enemy units one by one. However, numerous enemies began surrounding and enveloping themselves around the ships, causing them to explode from within, and it was not long enough until an enemy wrapped around Corbin's starship. Evelyn shot the unit down, telling Corbin to retreat and go back to base.

Nomansky's ship was entirely devoured by the monsters. "Requesting backup! We're surrounded! The enemy is devouring the energy of the bomb, using it to regenerate itself! We're not going to last down here!" ON-1, Corbin's suit, ended its emitters to preserve and maintain its functionality. But it was already too late; as the wormhole was about to close, Corbin and his suit were tossed away by the enemy ship out of the wormhole, back into his home planet.
