## About

Hi. My name is Frime. I'm a self-taught developer and former IT student, who also likes to write, and is also learning digital art on the side.

And welcome, my dear sojourners, to the _Helion_ universe,my science-fantasy saga set in dozens of vibrant yet strange new worlds.

I started writing around the final year of polytechnic and kept it up all the way past graduation and into the army. Since graduation, I've made new online friends who were keen and open to help me out, be it entertaining strange questions at ungodly hours of the night, or just correcting me on something I can't get right.

I originally created this story back when I was in polytechnic, but over the years and through the pandemic, this has evolved into an actual life goal, which is to one day publish this as a novel series both online and in print, and eventually, a webcomic.

My working title, _Rise of the Void_ is the main storyline. There have been many story ideas I've developed over the years, and even before I made Helion. But for now, this is the main focus, and is the first step in introducing the _Helion-verse_ to the world.

The story combines all my childhood and teenage influences, and I want to inject every bit of life from the grand adventures I experienced as a kid into my own personal world. I drew a lot from video games like Warframe, StarCraft, Destiny and League of Legends, franchises like Doom and Final Fantasy, and novels like Dune and Foundation.

I guess I write when I feel like there is an issue which should be discussed that I can put into a different perspective through a fictional world with fictional circumstances.

I'm hopeful that I'd be able to do all this while I am serving in the army. I write this mostly on my phone using <!-- a cracked version of --> JotterPad or IA Writer, especially since I'm outside a lot, and if I'm at home, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

This repository serves as a place to keep all my draft manuscripts and notes written since 2020 when I all of my notes in Markdown. I use Markdown when writing, especially when editing from multiple devices.

The final manuscript will not be stored here, only the WIPs.

## Synopsis

Enemies from an unknown domain triggered countless alarms throughout the galaxy. Dozens of colonies were raided, death following in their wake. A ruthless brawl broke out in space, and in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin was stranded on a remote planet, severely injured after a blast. And in a sliver of hope, an ancient gem heals and revives him, giving him one chance to resist.

In his journey to find and rescue his lost family, he chances upon four strong and powerful heroes from distant parts of the universe, from a young damsel of light to an ancient star dragon. Together, they set out on grand adventures across dozens of strange new worlds, finding the source of the mysterious power that plagued the universe for eons, with the universe and its fate solely on their hands.

## How did it begin?

The idea for this universe started out about four years ago, when I was still in my first year at IT school. I had been writing short stories for about a year since to help me score better in English.

Around June that year, I watched a RossDraws video on YouTube. Right there and then, I felt compelled to create my own fictional world; a chance to curate such a vivid, imaginary place as an escape from reality and when life generally went tough, especially right during the pandemic...besides jumping from platform to platform and consuming content while alone at home.

One day dad and I were discussing our favorite childhood shows and films, including One Punch Man, I proposed to him about this weird character idea I had. We settled on a sci-fi universe since we both liked StarCraft; Dad had finished both games when I was still a kid.

Eventually we started discussing and brainstorming more and more, often over coffee while playing Pokémon Go, and the highlight definitely wasn't the triple-shot of Chocolate Ice-Blended Frappe I always ordered at Starbucks, even during my internship mentoring sessions at my final year of polytechnic.

Dad wrote the key points to my story while I imagined the characters in my head and drew them out with his help. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, and sometimes an artbook, and at several points drafted plots and outlines, but while the story perpetually remains incomplete, it would only remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

Now, as I write this story while I serve in the army, I am very thankful to all the people who have helped and supported me thus far, and still continue to do so to this day. But this project wouldn't be possible at all without Dad who helped me get out of my comfort zone, spark my creativity, and being awesome.

## Heroes

### Corbin Knox

**_Corbin (age 19)_:** The fearful but selfless hero, and spiritual leader of the group. Once a dashing recruit with an insatiable hunger for adventure and space battles.

But abandoned on death's door after failing to save his parents, he encounters an ancient, sentient gem that not only heals him, and grants him supernatural abilities.

With this newfound power and determination, he sets out on the universe's most dangerous quest and encountering ever-stronger foes, all just to save his family from

### Diana Ennia

**_Diana (age 17)_:** The innocent and naïve childhood friend of Corbin, parting ways on a voyage to a different sector of the galaxy.

She was revived by the spirit of a neutron star when the galaxy's wars began, but immediately fell to the Void. For almost a century she was rendered both a slave and a weapon, destroying all who would try to suppress her.

After being rescued by Corbin, a weakened Diana struggles to gain back her powers, while trying to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster. She remains in a state of limbo from her corruption, but she swears on her life to never be corrupted ever again.

### Zaianíra raë-Korsúa

**_Zaia (age 18tn.)_:** A teenage "neon rogue" living on the edge. She's rebellious, reckless and ruthless, constantly pushing herself to the limit and putting herself in danger, in a chaotic universe where death is at her doorstep.

Born as a royal in her kingdom of Itira, Zaia was raised early on to be a warrior princess, training night and day with her parents in preparation for her rite of passage.

However, after barely surviving a war waged on Earth, a new surrogate body was made for her, an amalgamation of engineered proto-human flesh and alien cybernetic implants. With this new body, she could reach unparalleled speeds, adapt to any environment, and can face entire swathes of enemies with ease.

Yet, parts of her remained permanently damaged, resulting in her wildly unpredictable power and persona. Realizing she had committed a grave mistake, she still abandoned her royal title and went her own path, all just to "save her own kind".

### Elios sar-Arrakhi

**_Elios (age 4tn.)_:** The stoic mediator of the team. Speaks through visions, plans their next move and all the odds that could befall them. Taps into the minds and consciousness of his foes, enthralling them to his will.

He reveals that he was the last member of an ancient cosmic peacekeeping order dubbed the Conclave, tasked upon themselves to purge any Void evil before it overtakes anyone.

Now far away from Primordial status and clad in a rare metal armor, he befriended Drax. Together they travel the universe, training and conditioning battle-hungry Drax to know when and where to strike.

### Draxamâthron

**_Drax (age 4.0m.)_:**, an infernal dragon born from a core of a dying star, graces the vast emptiness of the cosmos, all to protect his own kind from the Void.

Having been saved by Elios himself after being subjugated by the Void in his previous life, Drax, now scarred and diminished into his lowest form, befriends him and soon joins Corbin on his quest.

His true form may be revealed only when necessary to become larger than a star, overwhelming his foes with valiant strength and an all-consuming fire.
