# Rise of the Void

_Rise of the Void_, or formerly, _Project: Helion_, is a science-fantasy story set in dozens of vibrant yet strange new worlds. The saga takes you on an immersive journey of exploration and discovery, with an expansive cast of travelers, companions and enemies.

The saga explores all my influences and inspirations dating all the way back into my childhood. I drew a lot of inspiration from games like _Warframe_, _League of Legends_, _StarCraft_ and _Destiny_, franchises like _Final Fantasy_ and _Halo_, films like _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_, and novels like _Dune_ and _Foundation_.

This repository serves as _source code_ for all the (draft) manuscripts for this saga, and also notes which I've gathered and written over the years pertaining to this universe when I'm not editing my manuscript. All are written in Markdown format.

> **Author's note**: At the time of writing this, yes, I will be serving NS/army in about less than a month's time. But when I'm at it, I'll still be working on my saga/universe though when I'm at home.

This is the first step in introducing the _Helion-verse_ to the world.

## How did all this begin?

When I was young, I was binge-watching countless space documentaries and short films on YouTube. It all started from YouTube when I was Primary 2, after watching those universe size comparison videos as a distraction from Disney. And during my pre- and early teens, old-time classics such as Star Wars, Star Trek and Dad's favorite game, StarCraft.

And in June 2019 when I was still a college freshman and info-tech student. I've been writing short stories and essays, but never before did I thought of writing a book. During that time, I tried many things such as writing, music production, and conlanging, trying to find something to do when I was still bored at home.

Then I watched a RossDraws video on YouTube, and so felt more compelled to create my own fictional universe, falling in live with worldbuilding and character design. To me, all this served as an escape from the constant skirmishes and bitter events I faced at school, work and most astoundingly, at home.

I jumped from platform to platform, fandom to fandom, browsing, collecting and consuming fan-made content, and since then I gotten a little bit closer to the art community and discovering original work by indie and respected artists alike. This venture was mainly to find inspiration for future characters and stories, which I did during my remaining time at college... besides saving thousands of fan-art on my phone through Twitter, though silly me forgot Pinterest existed.

And halfway from that point, I had character idea: one that had the power of manifesting his own dreams into reality. I then discussed about Corbin with Dad, and since we had a mutual love for space and sci-fi, we pitched ideas for his story and settled on a sci-fi universe.

As the months grew into years we continually pitched ideas for our story. Dad wrote the key points while I imagined the characters and the plot in my head, and then even drawing them on paper with his supervision. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, drafting a plot for good measure, but even though the story was left incomplete, it would only forever remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

My universe, as it was called back then, was one of the few things that allowed me to both escape from my problems and get out of my comfort zone. I'm still fighting through my innermost conflicts and fears as I try to find a place of peace and belonging in a world of chaos and uncertainty; in perhaps one of the most dreaded and unforeseen phases of my own life.

## Story and History

### The First War

Before the dawn of time, the One torn apart the Void, seeding domains throughout the multiverse with vast multitudes of galaxies. Each domain was birthed with uniquely sentient life, which throughout the eons grew into thriving civilizations inhabited by vastly different lifeforms.

Hidden in the cores of the celestial bodies lie the Relics of Creation, the Helion, binding to living hosts to tap into the very essence of the Cosmos, allowing for them to manipulate space and time itself.

Between the domains lie the Sanctuary, an alternate plane where the Watchers dwelled. They, primordial and countless in number, were ancient beings begat from the crystals themselves, destined to guide the empires to their intended purpose, while forging trust, peace and prosperity between the empires.

However, sin soon captured the hearts of some of the Celestials. One of the higher-ups, Omegron, second highest to the One, uncovered the secret of the Helion and their power. He wanted them all for himself, and this greed passed on to the many empires the Celestials guided.

The empires turned cruel and bitter in hatred, tussling among themselves to gain the Helion and their power. Warfare, be it with advanced technology or bizarre magic, raged across the universe, strong enough to rive even the empires which remained silent and peaceful.

For Omegron's betrayal and greed, the four other Luminaries, cast Omegron back into the nothingness of the Void after the First War. Knowing he was too weak to wage another, he and the rest of the fallen Celestials shaped their own empire from the crude matter of the Universe.

Populating this Void, the Void "devils" were designed with an extreme degree of adaptability, resilience and procreation. Coupled with their countless innate abilities, they proved to be a formidable threat to the Universe.

Time and time again, these erratic, sentient beings travel, observe, listen and learn to the secrets of the Universe at the bidding of their master in the Dark Void, only waiting for the day he would be set free.

As he slowly grew vengeful as a result of his loss, he sent his son Mavron, the Revenant, whom he created himself, under a humanoid guise to serve as a parasite, tasked to destroy the Universe from within and annihilate all the Helion crystals for his father and creator.

But furious against the atrocities of his father, Mavron turned away, subsuming a Helion crystal to subvert his identity. Abandoning his objective, he didn't destroy the Universe, but he sealed the Void-gates, keeping the Universe out of the Void's reach, effectively ending the First War.

### Itira

After the First War, only a few domains remained. Such were the elemental realms, the most powerful and advanced of which was Itira, an intergalactic, stratified yet prosperous empire left unscathed for ages.

Much of the planets they inhabit was entirely created from them, existing as abstract simulations controlled and sustained by their collective conscience down to the microscopic level.

Unlike most regions whose lifeforms are organic or elemental, their inhabitants, the eponymous Itira are mostly composed of inorganic energy, thus giving them an unmatched advantage no mortal or physical body could imagine.

But while the Itira do not possess a physical body, they almost always dwell inside a vessel, be it organic or synthetic, or perhaps [a mix of both](#zaia). Some more powerful Itira can assume projection of themselves, allowing them to shapeshift into beings large or small.

This alone makes the Itira biologically immortal, physically untouchable and far more superior in intellect. They could control their environment, instantaneously travel vast distances, and self-regenerate in case they are damaged.

However, despite the sheer limitless scope of power at their disposal, it would require a long time to master said powers, and even so, only a small handful can achieve.

Yet this did not stop them. With a motive to rebuild and repopulate their domain, aided by their extensive mastery of biotechnology and gene manipulation, they set out on a quest to re-conquer what was lost outside their domain, spearheaded by the ruling house of Korsua.

### Zaia

Born among the royals of the eons-old Itira empire was Zaianira, daughter of Daianira and Zoran-Ra Korsua. Training with her father since she was young, her father, Zoran taught her combat and movement skills, soaking up what she has learnt like a sponge.

But Zaia, as she preferred to be called, felt like she didn't belong to the royal house. She was always on the move seeking new adventures, venturing to distant planets within her domain, though oftentimes resorting to disguising herself to hide her true identity.

Training night and day, she practiced her combat skills through battle simulations in preparation for her rite of passage, the galaxy's Gauntlets, a seemingly endless mess of draconian labyrinths designed to be physically and mentally impossible for even the adept to complete.

Meanwhile, the Itira had been colonizing and seeding new smaller civilizations, including on Earth. Proposing to create a race of sentient beings from the genomes of the Nakta but imbued with their intellect, these beings would later evolve into the Humans.

But on Earth, Zaia and her allies were met with a rival empire, the Atala, who also created their own beings from the same genomes. Even though their experiment failed, the result proved lethal and indestructible.

While the Atala's primitive inventions were strong and fearless, they were quickly outwitted by the humans. But Zaia was the one who turned the tide, and as a result, her physical body was completely damaged and unable to be restored.

She, being a royal of great power, would die if she had no body to dwell in, so she had to inhabit in a prototype human's body, biologically re-engineered for her. However, this was all at the expense of losing even her sanity, as she frequently had bouts of intense rage and despair, making her unpredictable as a result.

She, together with her artificer and advisor Ledo, designed and enhanced her armor with fully synthetic parts, designed to adapt to any kind of damage while developing resistance to any harm, effectively turning her into a war machine that she could both live in and control.

As she matured, she had became used to her own body, fully synergizing with its biology while keeping her former abilities. But yet, holding onto all she had learnt from her parents, she still vowed to protect her own kind and her family, no matter if it risked losing her own body again.

She knew she had to follow a different path, and answer a bigger call, even if that meant that she had to let go of her royal title, family and kingdom for her own sake.

She could find someone to reveal her true powers, and give her ways she could use to defend herself against the all-powerful Void, but only time would tell of what remains of her.

## What is the story about?

Enemies from an unknown domain raided dozens of colonies throughout the Milky Way; death following in its wake.

A young recruit Corbin among hundreds were deployed into battle, piloting a space suit. Many of their weapons had proven ineffective, resulting in his side suffering heavy losses. And in a desperate attempt to rescue his parents, Corbin almost died, after succumbing to a blast.

The survivors were "taken captive". Corbin, and his robot were the only ones left.

Following a rare cosmic event some lightyears away, an ancient gem seeks him out, as Corbin used it as his only chance left to rescue his parents _again_ from the very force that stole them away.

Now Corbin was left stranded, with the gem keeping him and his frail body conscious and alive. while his companion robot, PAC-1, broadcasted signals around the galaxy seeking anyone left alive to come to his rescue.

Suddenly, as if in a dream, he notices a mysterious figure coming to rescue him, as he takes him outside the galaxy to find a place to rest.

As Corbin wakes up, he discovers that same mysterious figure, who reveals himself to be Elros, an ancient armored being with the ability to mind-control legions. He was accompanied by his "hunter" Drax a star-dragon in his diminished form.

The three arrive in a hostile alien world dotted with floating islands, and a harsh, dusty climate down below. With aih sirh
