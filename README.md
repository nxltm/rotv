## About

Hello there. My name is Noel, also known as Frime online. And I'm a self taught web developer and IT graduate, writing, coding, and drawing during my free time.

I started developing this story, Rise of the Void, since early 2019. At the time I was watching a YouTube course on character design, and combined with my old writing hobby I started a year prior, even though I didn't read any book yet since childhood. I began penning down some story ideas, and arrived about a superhero character that could manifest his dreams into reality. Dad proposed that we give him a story, settling on a sci-fi universe since we both liked the genre growing up.

Dad wrote the ideas to my story while I imagined them in my head and sketched them on paper with his help. We expanded on the story, giving him a diverse cast of companions, usually discussing over coffee. That continued throughout the pandemic, with me watching game trailers, digging through Pinterest, ArtStation and more. Now with my family, relatives, and friends' support, this venture has turned into an an actual life goal, which is to work on my trilogy as I serve in the army.

As I continue on ths venture of mine, I am very thankful to all the people who have supported and helped me thus far, many of whom still continue to do so to this day. But this project wouldn't be possible _at all_ without Dad, who helped me get out of my comfort zone, spark my creativity, and just being awesome.

This repository serves as the source code of my manuscripts, some dated back years ago. For the most part, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to write my novels, and also sometimes with [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

## Synopsis

Enemies from an unknown domain triggered countless alarms throughout the galaxy. Dozens of colonies were raided, death following in their wake. A ruthless brawl broke out in space, and in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin was stranded on a remote planet, severely injured after a blast. And in a sliver of hope, an ancient gem heals and revives him, giving him one chance to resist.

In his journey to find and rescue his lost family, he chances upon four strong and powerful heroes from distant parts of the universe, from a young damsel of light to an ancient star dragon. Together, they set out on grand adventures across dozens of strange new worlds, finding the source of the mysterious power that plagued the universe for eons, with the universe and its fate solely on their hands.

## Heroes

### Corbin Knox

**Corbin (age 1,960):** The fearful but selfless hero, and spiritual leader of the group. Once a dashing recruit with an insatiable hunger for adventure and space battles.

But abandoned on death's door after failing to save his parents, he encounters an ancient, sentient gem that not only heals him, and grants him supernatural abilities.

With this newfound power and determination, he sets out on a perilous quest across the universe as a "savior", breaking the chains that once bound his lost family. His ultimate test awaits: to lead a new war and take on the Void, before the universe is once more brought to ruin.

### Diana Ennia

**Diana (age 1,740):** The innocent and naïve childhood friend of Corbin, parting ways on a voyage to a different sector of the galaxy.

She was revived by the spirit of a neutron star when the galaxy's wars began, but immediately fell to the Void. For almost a century she was rendered both a slave and a weapon, destroying all who would try to suppress her.

After being rescued by Corbin, a weakened Diana struggles to gain back her powers, while trying to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster. She remains in a state of limbo from her corruption, but she swears on her life to never be corrupted ever again.

### Zaia Korsua

**Zaia (age unknown, going under 18):** She was once a royal warrior princess, destined to succeed her kingdom.

But during the Old War, a brutal Void force ravaged her galaxy. A violent coup d'état was led against her royal family, forcing her to stand against the ultimate enemy, herself, in the way of her parents, for her own sake.

Miraculously, her parents revived her, and she was successfully stored in a new surrogate body, an amalgam of protohuman flesh and alien cybernetics. With her new body, she could reach unbreakable speeds, adapt to any environment and can face countless enemies without fatigue.

Yet she remains permanently corrupted and her memories erased from her affliction with the Void. She, renaming herself as Zaia, now travels the universe alone as a mercenary, loyally serving her allies to defend against the Void during the last few laps of the Old War.

She remains the only Itira to date that ever ventured out of her realm, a realm not known by many. Over time and even after the war she gradually regained her memories of her past life.

### Elios sar-Arrakhi

**Elios (age 4tn.):** The stoic mediator of the team. Speaks through visions, plans their next move and all the odds that could befall them. Taps into the minds and consciousness of his foes, enthralling them to his will.

He reveals that he was the last member of an ancient cosmic peacekeeping order dubbed the Conclave, tasked upon themselves to purge any Void evil before it overtakes anyone.

Far away from Primordial status and clad in a rare metal armor, he befriended Amar after saving him, after he was on the verge of Void corruption. Now, together, they travel the universe, as Elios trained and conditioned battle-hungry Amar to know when and where to strike.

### Amar-athron

**Amar (age 4.0m.):** An infernal dragon born from a core of a dying star, graces the vast emptiness of the cosmos, all to protect his own kind from the Void.

Having been saved by Elios himself after being subjugated by the Void in his previous life, Amar, now scarred and diminished into his lowest form, befriends him and soon joins Corbin on his quest.

His true form may be revealed only when necessary to become larger than a star, overwhelming his foes with valiant strength and an all-consuming fire.
