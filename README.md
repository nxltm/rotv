# Rise of the Void

_Rise of the Void_, or formerly, _Project: Helion_, is a science-fantasy story set in dozens of vibrant yet strange new worlds. The saga takes you on an immersive journey of exploration and discovery, with an expansive cast of travelers, companions and enemies.

This story explores all my influences and inspirations dating all the way back into my childhood. I draw a lot of inspiration from games like _Warframe_, _League of Legends_, _StarCraft_ and _Destiny_, franchises like _Final Fantasy_ and _Halo_, films like _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_, and novels like _Dune_ and _Foundation_.

This repository serves as _source code_ for all the (draft) manuscripts for this saga, and also notes which I've gathered and written over the years pertaining to this universe when I'm not editing my manuscript. All are written in Markdown format.

> **Author's note**: At the time of writing this, yes, I will be serving NS/army in about less than a month's time. But when I'm at it, I'll still be working on my saga/universe though when I'm at home.

This is the first step in introducing the _Helion-verse_ to the world.

## What is the story about?

Enemies from an unknown domain raided dozens of colonies throughout the Milky Way; death following in its wake.

A young recruit Corbin among hundreds were deployed into battle, piloting a space suit. Many of their weapons had proven ineffective, resulting in his side suffering heavy losses. And in a desperate attempt to rescue his parents, Corbin almost died, after succumbing to a blast.

The survivors were "taken captive". Corbin, and his robot were the only ones left.

Following a rare cosmic event some lightyears away, an ancient gem seeks him out, as Corbin used it as his only chance left to rescue his parents _again_ from the very force that stole them away.

Now Corbin was left stranded, with the gem keeping him and his frail body conscious and alive. while his companion robot, PAC-1, broadcasted signals around the galaxy seeking anyone left alive to come to his rescue.

Suddenly, in his dreams, he notices a mysterious figure coming to rescue him, as he takes him outside the galaxy to find another place to rest.

As Corbin wakes up, he discovers that same mysterious figure, who reveals himself to be Elros, an ancient armored being with the ability to mind-control legions. He was accompanied by his "hunter" Drax (short for Draxamathron), a star-dragon in his diminished form.

## How did all this begin?

The original idea for this universe sparked in June 2019 when I was still a college freshman and info-tech student. I've been writing short stories and essays, but never before did I thought of writing a book. Then I watched a RossDraws video on YouTube, and so felt more compelled to create my own fictional universe, falling in live with worldbuilding and character design.

To me, all this served as an escape from the constant skirmishes and bitter events I faced at school, work and most importantly, with family. And then a character idea came to mind when 



Emotionally riven by night terrors and horrors I created a self-insert, one which had the rather absurd-at-first power of controlling and manifesting his dreams into his surroundings. I then discussed the story with Dad, and since we had a mutual love for space and sci-fi, we settled on such. I was binge-watching countless space documentaries and short films on YouTube to find inspiration for future characters and stories, which I did during my remaining time at college... besides saving thousands of fan-art on my phone through Twitter.

As the months grew into years we continually pitched ideas for our story. Dad wrote the key points while I imagined the characters and the plot in my head, and then even drawing them on paper with his supervision. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, drafting a plot for good measure, but even though the story was left incomplete, it would only forever remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

My universe, Helion, as it was called back then, was one of the few things that allowed me to both escape from my problems and get out of my comfort zone. I'm still fighting through my innermost conflicts and fears as I try to find a place of peace and belonging in a world of chaos and uncertainty; in perhaps one of the most dreaded and unforeseen phases of my own life.
