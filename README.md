## About

Hello there.

My (nick)name is Frime. And I'm a self-taught web developer and IT student who _also_ likes to write. And welcome to the **Helion** universe, my far-future fantasy saga set in dozens of strange new worlds.

I started writing this story since June 2019, and kept it up all the way past the pandemic, graduation and even the army. This has evolved into an actual life goal, which si to one day publish this as an online series, both online and in print, and eventually, a webcomic.

Since the beginning of this year, I've made new online friends who were keen and open to help me out, be it entertaining strange questions even at ungodly hours of the night, or just correcting me if I can't express something right.

Corbin's story, Rise of the Void, is the main storyline and what I will be focusing on from here on out. There have been many story ideas I've developed since childhood, even before I made this universe.

I want to inject every bit of vivid memories from the grand adventures I experienced since childhood into this personal world. I drew a lot of inspiration from novels like Foundation and Dune, video games like Warframe, Destiny and League of Legends, and franchises like Doom, Final Fantasy and the Marvel cinematic universe.

This repository serves as a place to keep all my draft manuscripts about my universe, all written in Markdown. I mostly edit from my phone with either IA Writer and JotterPad, and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) on my desktop.

Only the final manuscript will not be stored here.

## Synopsis

Enemies from an unknown domain triggered countless alarms throughout the galaxy. Dozens of colonies were raided, death following in their wake. A ruthless brawl broke out in space, and in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin was stranded on a remote planet, severely injured after a blast. And in a sliver of hope, an ancient gem heals and revives him, giving him one chance to resist.

In his journey to find and rescue his lost family, he chances upon four strong and powerful heroes from distant parts of the universe, from a young damsel of light to an ancient star dragon. Together, they set out on grand adventures across dozens of strange new worlds, finding the source of the mysterious power that plagued the universe for eons, with the universe and its fate solely on their hands.

## How did it begin?

The idea for this universe started out about four years ago, when I was still in my first year at IT school. I had been writing short stories for about a year since to help me score better in English.

Around June that year, I watched a RossDraws video on YouTube. Right there and then, I felt compelled to create my own fictional world; a chance to curate such a vivid, imaginary place as an escape from reality and when life generally went tough, especially right during the pandemic...besides jumping from platform to platform and consuming content while alone at home.

One day, Dad and I were discussing our favorite childhood shows and films, including One Punch Man, I proposed to him about this weird character idea I had. We settled on a sci-fi universe since we both liked StarCraft; Dad had finished both games when I was still a kid.

Eventually we started discussing and brainstorming more and more, often over coffee while playing Pokémon Go, and the highlight definitely wasn't the triple-shot of Chocolate Ice-Blended Frappe I always ordered at Starbucks, even during my internship mentoring sessions at my final year of polytechnic.

Dad wrote the key points to my story while I imagined the characters in my head and drew them out with his help. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, and sometimes an artbook, and at several points drafted plots and outlines, but while the story perpetually remains incomplete, it would only remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

Now, as I write this story while I serve in the army, I am very thankful to all the people who have helped and supported me thus far, and still continue to do so to this day. But this project wouldn't be possible at all without Dad who helped me get out of my comfort zone, spark my creativity, and being awesome.

## Heroes

### Corbin Knox

**Corbin (age 19):** The fearful but selfless hero, and spiritual leader of the group. Once a dashing recruit with an insatiable hunger for adventure and space battles.

But abandoned on death's door after failing to save his parents, he encounters an ancient, sentient gem that not only heals him, and grants him supernatural abilities.

With this newfound power and determination, he sets out on a perilous quest across the universe as a "savior", breaking the chains that once bound his lost family. His ultimate test awaits: to lead a new war and take on the Void, before the universe is once more brought to ruin.

### Diana Ennia

**Diana (age 17):** The innocent and naïve childhood friend of Corbin, parting ways on a voyage to a different sector of the galaxy.

She was revived by the spirit of a neutron star when the galaxy's wars began, but immediately fell to the Void. For almost a century she was rendered both a slave and a weapon, destroying all who would try to suppress her.

After being rescued by Corbin, a weakened Diana struggles to gain back her powers, while trying to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster. She remains in a state of limbo from her corruption, but she swears on her life to never be corrupted ever again.

### Zaia Korsua

**Zaia (age unknown going under 18)**: A prodigious yet impulsive teenage royal mercenary, forced to abandon her empire after a Void attack left her father and brother killed during the Old War.

Having barely survived after slaying entire swathes of Voidspawn on her own, she placed herself in a surrogate body: an amalgam of engineered proto-human flesh, and alien cybernetic augments.

With her new body, she could reach unparalleled strength and speeds, adapt better to any environment, and can face countless enemies without fatigue. Yet, her conscience remained permanently damaged, resulting in her wildly chaotic persona, much less her abilities.

Forever livid with rage on her adversaries, she now travels alone, ready to strike from all angles. For she knows only one thing: violence is the only answer.

### Elios sar-Arrakhi

**Elios (age 4tn.):** The stoic mediator of the team. Speaks through visions, plans their next move and all the odds that could befall them. Taps into the minds and consciousness of his foes, enthralling them to his will.

He reveals that he was the last member of an ancient cosmic peacekeeping order dubbed the Conclave, tasked upon themselves to purge any Void evil before it overtakes anyone.

Far away from Primordial status and clad in a rare metal armor, he befriended Drax after saving him, after he was on the verge of Void corruption. Now, together, they travel the universe, as Elros trained and conditioned battle-hungry Drax to know when and where to strike.

### Draxamâthron

**Drax (age 4.0m.):** , an infernal dragon born from a core of a dying star, graces the vast emptiness of the cosmos, all to protect his own kind from the Void.

Having been saved by Elios himself after being subjugated by the Void in his previous life, Drax, now scarred and diminished into his lowest form, befriends him and soon joins Corbin on his quest.

His true form may be revealed only when necessary to become larger than a star, overwhelming his foes with valiant strength and an all-consuming fire.

## Thanks

This project is dedicated to Dad who always helped me expand my imagination and shown his support for me as I am writing this story and serving in the army.

This book would never have been created if not for the times both of us fantasized and brainstormed ideas together, and for always believing in me even through the storm.

And to those whom I met online through Discord or my socials, and who constantly believed in me: @ArtdipityX, @YuneShiun, @Astrodart, @DaftMindless, @Emogakuu and many others.

God bless, and thank you all.
