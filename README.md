## About

I originally created this back then in college, but with time this has evolved into an actual life goal, which is to one day publish this as a book series (and after that, either a game or a film). And I'm hopeful that fate would allow me to do that before I graduate from army.

Yes I write this mostly on my phone, and sometimes in an IDE on my laptop.

_Rise of the Void_, or formerly, _Project: Helion_, is a science-fantasy story set in dozens of vibrant yet strange new worlds.

The saga explores all my influences and inspirations dating all the way back into my childhood. I drew a lot of inspiration from games like _Warframe_, _League of Legends_, _StarCraft_ and _Destiny_, franchises like _Final Fantasy_ and _Halo_, films like _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_, and novels like _Dune_ and _Foundation_.

This repository serves as _source code_ for all the (draft) manuscripts for this saga, and also notes which I've gathered and written over the years pertaining to this universe when I'm not editing my manuscript. All are written in Markdown format.

This is the first step in introducing the _Helion-verse_ to the world.

## Synopsis

Enemies from an unknown domain triggered countless alarms throughout the galaxy. Dozens of colonies were raided, death following in their wake. A ruthless brawl broke out in space, and in a failed attempt to save his parents, Corbin was stranded on a remote planet, severely injured after a blast. And in a sliver of hope, an ancient gem heals and revives him, giving him one chance to resist.

In his journey to find and rescue his lost family, he chances upon four strong and powerful heroes from distant parts of the universe, from a young damsel of light to an ancient star dragon. Together, they set out on grand adventures across dozens of strange new worlds, finding the source of the mysterious power that plagued the universe for eons, with the universe and its fate solely on their hands.

> **Author's note**: At the time of writing this, yes, I will be serving NS/army in about less than a month's time. But when I'm at it, I'll still be working on my saga/universe though when I'm at home.

## How did all this begin?

The idea for this universe started out about four years ago, when I was still in my first year at IT school. I had been writing short stories for about a year since to help me score better in English.

Around June that year, I watched a RossDraws video on YouTube. Right there and then, I felt compelled to create my own fictional world; a chance to curate such a vivid, imaginary place as an escape from reality and when life generally went tough, especially right during the pandemic...besides jumping from platform to platform and consuming content while alone at home.

One day dad and I were discussing our favorite childhood shows and films, including One Punch Man, I proposed to him about this weird character idea I had. We settled on a sci-fi universe since we both liked StarCraft; Dad had finished both games before I was born.

Eventually we started discussing and brainstorming more and more, often over coffee while playing Pok&eacute;mon Go, as my brother was taking his bass classes, and I vividly remember every triple shot of chocolate frappe at Starbucks.

Dad wrote the key points to my story while I imagined the characters in my head and drew them out with his help. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, and sometimes an artbook, and at several points drafted plots and outlines, but while the story perpetually remains incomplete, it would only remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

So for now, as I write this story in a code editor while serving in the army, I am very thankful to all the people who have helped and supported me thus far, and still continue to do so to this day. But this project wouldn't be possible at all without Dad who helped me get out of my comfort zone, spark my creativity, and being awesome.

## Heroes

### Corbin Knox

> I have someone to love. Someone to protect. Someone to save.

Corbin, the fearful but selfless hero, and spiritual leader of the group. Once a dashing recruit with an insatiable hunger for adventure and space battles.

After failing to save his parents and abandoned on death's door, he encounters an ancient gem that not only heals him, but grants him reality-altering abilities.

With this newfound determination and power, he sets out to bring justice to those who wronged him.

His mother gave him a companion robot, PAC-1 (Personal Assistive Combatant) which she had designed and built herself for years to aid him in his travels.

### Diana Ennia

> They consumed and destroyed me. Now, I am reborn and free.

Diana, the innocent and naÃ¯ve childhood friend of Corbin, parting ways on a voyage to a different sector of the galaxy.

She was revived by the spirit of a neutron star when the galaxy's wars began, but immediately fell to the Void. For almost a century she was rendered both a slave and a weapon, destroying all who would try to suppress her.

After being rescued by Corbin, a weakened Diana struggles to gain back her powers, while trying to forgive those that once called her a sadist, tyrant or monster.

She remains in a state of limbo from her corruption, but she swears on her last life to never be controlled ever again.

### Zaia Korsua

> - Guess someone's out here better than me.
> - Leave nothing alive.
> - Killed it. As always.
> - You can't stop what's coming.
> - Only time will tell.
> - Infinite lives, infinite chances.

Zaia, a "teenage" neon rogue with a complex persona: rebellious, adventurous, sociable and competitive on the outside, but deep down, she remains a loving and loyal friend.

Born into a royal family, Zaia was raised early on to be a warrior, training night and day with her parents and soaking up new parkour and combat knowledge like a sponge.

After barely surviving a war waged by a great empire, she was forced to store herself in a hybrid, biomechanical humanoid vessel. With this new body, she could adapt to any environment, reach breakneck speeds, and can face entire swathes of enemies with ease.

She longed for things to be how they were before the war, but she had no other choice but to abandon her royal title for her family's sake, even if it would risk dying again.

### Elios sar-Anirak

> Come with me and you will live.

Elios, the stoic mediator of the team. Speaks through visions, plans their next move and all the odds that could befall them. Taps into the minds and consciousness of his foes, enthralling them to his will.

He reveals that he was the last member of an ancient cosmic peacekeeping order dubbed the Conclave, tasked upon themselves to purge any Void evil before it overtakes anyone.

Now far away from Primordial status and clad in a rare metal armor, he befriended Drax. Together they travel the universe, hunting down those who would bring the universe to ruin.

### Drax Mathron

> Drax shall protect you, with his life!

Drax, an infernal dragon born from a core of a dying star, graces the vast emptiness of the cosmos, all to protect his own kind from the Void.

Having been saved by Elios himself after being subjugated by the Void in his previous life, Drax, now scarred and diminished into his lowest form, befriends him and soon joins Corbin on his quest.

His true form may be revealed only when necessary to become larger than a star, overwhelming his foes with pure strength and blazing fire.

### Talia Liro

Talia, a nomad born into her tribe of Liro, was torn after missing her rite of passage.

Guided by an amulet bestowed to her by her parents, she took on a journey to learn her true nature of her growing powers, leading her into a cave where an ancient stone once laid for eons.

She was wrapped inside a cocoon, transforming her into a new, even more powerful creature when the Void came to raid her domain too.

With bright-shining crystals adorning her, she could both move continents and rip apart planets, driven by the sheer will and spirit of the Geo-Helion.

# Why This Story

Helion is a story aimed for teens and young adults about finding a place in the universe amidst a world full of chaos and corruption. Taking place in the far future, Corbin's story will take you through an immersive journey of discovery and exploration, with a dynamic cast of companions, travelers and enemies.

This story explores all my childhood influences and inspirations and I want to inject every bit of life from the grand adventures I experienced as a kid into this world.

# Origins

The original idea for this universe sparked about five years ago when I was still a college freshman, around the same time. As I was going through a major period of anxiety during and after COVID-19, especially in the form of night terrors and horrors, I created Corbin Knox, my self insert, as a personal hero: I gave him the power to control his dreams and manifest them into reality.

I then discussed the story with Dad, and since we had a mutual love for space and sci-fi and we both liked Star Wars and StarCraft, we settled on a sci-fi universe... I was binge-watching a lot of space documentaries and watching countless short films on YouTube to find inspiration for future characters and stories, and that I did during my remaining time at college.

As the months grew into years we continually pitched ideas for our story. Dad wrote the key points while I imagined the characters and the plot in my head, and then even drawing them on paper with his supervision. I initially thought of writing a book or novel, drafting a plot for good measure, but even though the story was left incomplete, it would only forever remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories I had with him.

My personal universe, Helion, as it was called, was one of the few things that allowed me to both escape from my problems and get out of my comfort zone. I'm still fighting through my innermost conflicts and fears as I try to find a place of peace and belonging in a world of chaos and uncertainty; in perhaps one of the most dreaded and unforeseen phases of my personal life.

## Goals

The first goal is to make an artbook entirely dedicated to the characters, races and regions that would make up the story. The universe is vast, and the artbook is estimated to have a total of 100 pages or more. The deadline for this is October 2024.

If we could get to our stretch goal of \$10,000 I can complete the entire artbook myself, with help from a few friends. I'm currently serving national service while working on the plot, and raising funds to get an iPad Pro through doodle commissions, so I could immediately begin work on the artbook.

Our ultimate goal is to get the first issue out, and build a community so I could make more. I have 30+ characters mapped out with outlines for each of the regions. I also hope to make some merch such as T-shirts, posters and more!

**Estimated delivery: June 3 2024** **Funding period: April 11 2024 - May 31 2024**
